### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edward, an English full-stack developer building my applications with NodeJS, GoLang, PHP and C++ along with a variety of front-end frameworks, such as React and Vue (My favourite, of course, I'm not a fan of Facebook nor any of their software engineer's creations). I'm a strong believer in people's right to privacy and free speech and try to incorporate this in all of my works. As well as development, I'm also a keen designer currently operating my clothing brand, danger.capital which adopts the made to order principle, as not to upset the environment too much.

I'm building lots of other exciting projects. Visit [my website](https://jibson.me) to find out more. Or, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eddiejibson/jibson.me) (I'm a huge believer in Open Source).

These stats are not as impressive as they once would've been - I tend not to use GitHub as much anymore, I get on better with GitLab and Bitbucket (however, see previous year's commits if you're intrigued how active I used to be here)

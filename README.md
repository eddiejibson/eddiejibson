### Hi there 👋

I'm Edward, an English full-stack developer building my applications with NodeJS, GoLang, PHP and C++ along with a variety of frontend frameworks, such as React and Vue (My favourite of course, I'm not a fan of Facebook nor any of their software engineer's creations). I'm a strong believer in people's right to privacy and free-speech and try to incorporate this in all of my projecsts. As well as my development, I'm also a keen designer currently operating my own clothing brand, [danger.capital](https://danger.capital) which adopts the made to order principle, as not to upset the environment too much.

I'm building lots of other exciting projects. Visit [my website](https://jibson.me) to find out more. Or, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eddiejibson/jibson.me) (I'm a huge believer in Open Source).

📫 How to reach me:

Email: eddie@jibson.me

Oh, and by the way, I'm always open to collaborate or help with anyone's open source project, reach out if you have something that you think would interest me.

These stats are not as impressive as they once would've been - I tend not to use GitHub as much anymore, I get on better with GitLab and Bitbucket (however, see previous year's commits if you're intrigued how active I used to be here)

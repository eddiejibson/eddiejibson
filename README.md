### Hi there 👋

I'm Edward, an English full-stack developer building my applications with NodeJS, GoLang, PHP and C++ along with a variety of web frameworks including React and Vue (My favourite, of course, I'm not a fan of Facebook nor any of their software engineer's creations). I'm a strong believer in people's right to privacy and free speech and try to incorporate this in all of my works. As well as development, I'm also a keen designer (trying to ignore when I [did speedarts for myself on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YVxJb3S2lw)) currently operating my clothing brand, [danger.capital](https://danger.capital) which adopts the made to order principle, as not to upset the environment too much.

I'm building lots of other exciting projects. Visit [my website](https://jibson.co) to find out more.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edward, an English full-stack developer building my applications with NodeJS, GoLang, PHP and C++ along with a variety of we  frameworks, such as React and Vue (My favourite, of course, I'm not a fan of Facebook nor any of their software engineer's creations). I'm a strong believer in people's right to privacy and free speech and try to incorporate this in all of my works. As well as development, I'm also a keen designer currently operating my clothing brand, [danger.capital](https://danger.capital) which adopts the made to order principle, as not to upset the environment too much.

I'm building lots of other exciting projects. Visit [my website](https://jibson.co) to find out more.

Oh, and by the way, I'm always open to collaborate or help with anyone's open source project, reach out if you have something that you think would interest me.
